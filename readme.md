# Space gun project


## Scope

- The planetoids will be represented by ellipsoids
- We will make the simulation somewhat modular, so that we can plug in various functions for things such as
	+ Atmospheric density at position
	+ Gravity at position
- The projectile must have the following properties
	+ Mass
	+ Surface aera
	+ Drag coefficient
